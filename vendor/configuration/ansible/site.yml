# devtest hosts correspond to the dev, lab and vagrant based machines for contiv projects.
# Here we will install the base packages needed for those environments.
# XXX: this is used by the 'contiv/build' project right now. But hopefully soon
# we can use it as replacement for 'contiv/lab' with some more refinements.
